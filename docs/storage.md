# Storage settings

One of the most helpful features of django-dbbackup is the ability to store
and retrieve backups from a local or a remote storage. This functionality is
mainly based on Django Storage API and extends its possibilities.

You can choose your backup storage backend by setting `settings.STORAGES['dbbackup']`,
it must be the full path of a storage class. For example:
`django.core.files.storage.FileSystemStorage` to use file system storage. 
Below, we'll list some of the available solutions and their options.

The storage's option are gathered in `settings.STORAGES['dbbackup']['OPTIONS']` which
is a dictionary of keywords representing how to configure it.

```python
STORAGES = {
    "default": {
        "BACKEND": "django.core.files.storage.FileSystemStorage",
        "OPTIONS": {
        ...your_options_here
        },
    },
    "staticfiles": {
        ...
    },
}
```

!!! warning
    Do not configure backup storage with the same configuration as your media
    files as you'll risk sharing backups inside public directories.

By default DBBackup uses the [built-in file system storage](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/files/storage/#the-filesystemstorage-class) to manage files on
a local directory. Feel free to use any Django storage, you can find a variety
of them at [Django Packages](https://djangopackages.org/grids/g/storage-backends/).

!!! note
    Storing backups to local disk may also be useful for Dropbox if you
    already have the official Dropbox client installed on your system.

## File system storage

### Setup

To store your backups on the local file system, simply setup the required
settings below.

```python
STORAGES = {
    "dbbackup": {
        "BACKEND": "django.core.files.storage.FileSystemStorage",
        "OPTIONS": {
            "location": "/my/backup/dir/",
        },
    },
}
```

### Settings

**location**

Absolute path to the directory that will hold the files.

**file_permissions_mode**

The file system permissions that the file will receive when it is saved.

**directory_permissions_mode**

The file system permissions that the directory will receive when it is saved.

See [FileSystemStorage's documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/files/storage/#the-filesystemstorage-class) for a full list of available settings.

## Google cloud storage

Our backend for Google cloud storage uses django-storages.

### Setup

In order to backup to Google cloud storage, you'll first need to create an account at google. Once that is complete, you can follow the required setup below.

```bash
pip install django-storages[google]
```

Add the following to your project's settings. Strictly speaking only `bucket_name` is required, but we'd recommend to add the other two as well. You can also find more settings in the readme for [django-storages](https://django-storages.readthedocs.io/en/latest/backends/gcloud.html)

```python
STORAGES = {
    "dbbackup": {
        "BACKEND": "storages.backends.gcloud.GoogleCloudStorage",
        "OPTIONS": {
            "bucket_name": "your_bucket_name",
            "project_id": "your_project_id",
            "blob_chunk_size": 1024 * 1024,
        },
    },
}
```

## Amazon S3

Our S3 backend uses Django Storages which uses [boto3](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html).

### Setup

In order to backup to Amazon S3, you'll first need to create an Amazon
Webservices Account and setup your Amazon S3 bucket. Once that is
complete, you can follow the required setup below.

```bash
pip install django-storages[boto3]
```

Add the following to your project's settings:

```python
STORAGES = {
    "dbbackup": {
        "BACKEND": "storages.backends.s3boto3.S3Boto3Storage",
        "OPTIONS": {
            "access_key": "my_id",
            "secret_key": "my_secret",
            "bucket_name": "my_bucket_name",
            "default_acl": "private",
        },
    }
}
```

### Settings

!!! note
    See the [Django Storage S3 storage official documentation](https://django-storages.readthedocs.io/en/latest/backends/amazon-S3.html) for all options.

    The options listed here are a selection of dictionary keys returned by
    `get_default_settings` in django-storages' [storages/backends/s3boto3.py](https://github.com/jschneier/django-storages/blob/master/storages/backends/s3boto3.py#L293-L324),
    which allows us to write nicer code compared to using the `AWS_` prefixed
    settings.

**access_key** - Required

Your AWS access key as string. This can be found on your [Amazon Account Security Credentials page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#security_credential).

**secret_key** - Required

Your Amazon Web Services secret access key, as a string.

**bucket_name** - Required

Your Amazon Web Services storage bucket name, as a string. This directory must
exist before attempting to create your first backup.

**region_name** - Optional

Specify the Amazon region, e.g. `'us-east-1'`.

**endpoint_url** - Optional

Set this to fully override the endpoint, e.g. to use an alternative S3 service,
which is compatible with AWS S3. The value must contain the protocol, e.g.
`'https://compatible-s3-service.example.com'`.

If setting this, it is mandatory to also configure **region_name**.

**default_acl** - Required

This setting can either be `'private'` or `'public'`. Since you want your
backups to be secure you'll want to set `'default_acl'` to `'private'`.

*NOTE: This value will be removed in a future version of django-storages.*
See their [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/jschneier/django-storages/blob/master/CHANGELOG.rst) for details.

**location** - Optional

If you want to store your backups inside a particular folder in your bucket you need to specify the `'location'`.
The folder can be specified as `'folder_name/'`.
You can specify a longer path with `'location': 'root_folder/sub_folder/sub_sub_folder/'`.

## Dropbox

In order to backup to Dropbox, you'll first need to create a Dropbox account
and set it up to communicate with the Django-DBBackup application. Don't
worry, all instructions are below.

### Setup

First, configure your Dropbox account by following these steps:

1. Login to Dropbox and navigate to Developers Â» MyApps.
   https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps

2. Click the button to create a new app and name it whatever you like.
   As an example, I named mine 'Website Backups'.

3. After your app is created, note the options button and more
   importantly the 'App Key' and 'App Secret' values inside. You'll need
   those later.

Then, configure your Django project by installing the required
dependencies:

```bash
pip install dropbox django-storages
```

And make sure you have the following required settings:

```python
STORAGES = {
    "dbbackup": {
        "BACKEND": "storages.backends.dropbox.DropBoxStorage",
        "OPTIONS": {
            "oauth2_access_token": "my_token",
        },
    },
}
```

### Settings

!!! note
    See [django-storages dropbox official documentation](https://django-storages.readthedocs.io/en/latest/backends/dropbox.html) for more details.

**oauth2_access_token** - Required

Your OAuth access token

**root_path**

Jail storage to this directory

## FTP

To store your database backups on a remote filesystem via FTP, simply
setup the required settings below.

### Setup

```bash
pip install django-storages
```

!!! warning
    This storage doesn't use a private connection for communication so don't use it
    if you're not certain about the security of the link between the client and the server.

```python
STORAGES = {
    "dbbackup": {
        "BACKEND": "storages.backends.ftp.FTPStorage",
        "OPTIONS": {

        },
    },
}
```

setup the required settings below.

### Setup

This backend is from Django-Storages with the [paramiko](https://www.paramiko.org/) backend.

```bash
pip install paramiko django-storages
```

The following configuration grants SSH server access to the local user:

```python
STORAGES = {
    "dbbackup": {
        "BACKEND": "storages.backends.sftpstorage.SFTPStorage",
        "OPTIONS": {
            'host': 'myserver',
